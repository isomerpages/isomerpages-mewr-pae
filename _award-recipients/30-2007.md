*Under Prof Tan’s leadership, NParks has grown from a green infrastructure builder to a provider of exciting lifestyle and recreational experiences amidst our parks and greenery.*

Professor Tan served as Chairman of NParks between 1998 and June 2007.   Under Prof Tan’s leadership, NParks has grown from a green infrastructure builder to a provider of exciting lifestyle and recreational experiences amidst our parks and greenery. He also helped elevate the vision of Singapore as a Garden City to that of a City in a Garden, raising our international brand and standing significantly.

A significant project initiated under Prof Tan’s tenure is the 101-ha Gardens by the Bay. Situated in the heart of downtown Marina Bay, the Gardens has attracted widespread interest in the international landscape and horticultural fraternity as a bold development to augment Singapore’s claim as a global city of distinction. Another major project that has raised the profile of the local landscape industry considerably is the inaugural Singapore Garden Festival held last December to showcase our horticultural excellence to both local and foreign visitors.

Prof Tan initiated and saw to the development of new regional parks like the Choa Chu Kang Park and the Punggol Park, and the upgrading of key gardens and parks like the Singapore Botanic Gardens, East Coast Park and West Coast Park. To date, NParks has also made considerable progress to give Singaporeans better access to our parks and nature reserves through the Park Connector Network.

Prof Tan made significant contributions in nature conservation and marine biology education. Through his personal championing of the conservation of the ecosystems at Labrador, the park was re-designated as the protected Labrador Nature Reserve. A hands-on conservation leader, he initiated numerous reforestation projects. Today, a thriving mangrove community lives in Pulau Semakau as a result of the technical expertise contribution by Prof Tan.

Prof Tan also actively helped NParks to forge links and partnership with local NGOs in nature conservation programmes. Through such efforts, NParks has today built a strong network of volunteers and supports to help in our greening and conservation efforts.

*CDL believes that everyone can play a role in protecting and conserving the environment through responsible business practices and community outreach initiatives*

A property pioneer since 1963, CDL is mindful of the impact its operations have on the environment and strives to apply good eco-friendly practices in its business. As a socially responsible corporate citizen, it is part of our corporate green philosophy to develop residential and commercial properties with environmental sustainability in mind as we believe in caring and protecting our environment.

In 2003, CDL was the first private property developer in Singapore to be awarded the ISO 14001:1996 for Environmental Management System (upgraded to ISO14001:2004 recently) by the Building and Construction Authority for its commitment to raising environmental standards in its projects and incorporating eco-friendly features into its developments. CDL also received the OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management System) certification for establishing an EHS policy to monitor the environmental impact of its operations and improve workplace safety. This year, CDL will be receiving the ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 in Property Investment for 16 of its investment buildings.

CDL strongly advocates a “Safe and Green” culture and has strict adherence to its Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy which was instituted in 2003 to monitor and focus on issues such as energy usage, water, waste management, workplace safety 	and public health issues. Through CDL’s 5-star EHS Assessment System, CDL contractors are appraised on their performance and graded on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Quarterly audits are conducted by independent auditors appointed by CDL and review seminars are held to share the assessment results and practices. Through training and knowledge sharing, this system serves as a platform for continuous improvement, and reinforces environmental awareness amongst all parties in the construction value chain.

With the objective to create homes that are eco-friendly and energy efficient, CDL developed its first Eco-Condo - Savannah CondoPark which features many eco-friendly attributes. In recognition of its green efforts, CDL received the Building and Construction Authority’s Green Mark Gold Award for Savannah CondoPark. CDL is also the first to receive the Green Mark Platinum Award for a private commercial project and private residential development with City Square Mall which will also be Singapore’s first eco-mall and The Oceanfront @ Sentosa Cove. In the last three years, 16 CDL projects have been awarded a Green Mark, the most of any developer.

Beyond building quality homes, CDL goes the extra mile to influence customers to do their part for a better environment. In March 2004, CDL was the first private property developer to launch “Let’s Live Green!” – an eco-home initiative which encourages CDL homebuyers to practise eco-friendly habits in their new homes. Through a series of talks, exhibitions and activities co-organised with the Singapore Environment Council (SEC), CDL encourages homeowners play a part in environment conservation,  through the 3Rs - Recycling, Reducing and Reusing.

For office workers and tenants, CDL has put in place a permanent recycling programme for 17 of its commercial buildings. To further cultivate eco-friendly habits in the office, CDL started “Project Eco-Office” with SEC in June 2002. Since then, through a series of roadshows, seminars and recycling drives, CDL has successfully raised environment awareness among the office crowd.

As part of its community outreach, CDL also supports many national initiatives including the National Environment Agency’s Corporate and School Partnership Programme since 2005 when CDL “adopted” Catholic High School (Primary). This year, CDl has adopted Catholic High (Secondary) as well as St. Nicholas Girls’ School (Primary and Secondary) as well.

CDL believes that everyone can play a role in protecting and conserving the environment through responsible business practices and community outreach initiatives. Together, we can make a difference.

*Throughout his career, Mr Tan has played a significant role in growing and strengthening Singapore’s water supply system to what it is today.*

As the Chairman of PUB, the national water agency since 2001, Mr Tan Gee Paw has contributed greatly to the environment and water sectors in Singapore. One of his key achievements includes overseeing the development and implementation of NEWater, or high-grade water reclaimed from treated used water. Under his leadership and guidance, PUB successfully introduced NEWater as a sustainable water source to meet Singapore’s water challenges in 2001.
 
At PUB, Mr Tan brought about the integration of water, drainage and sewerage services under one agency. This allowed Singapore to manage its water in a holistic manner by ‘closing the water loop’ and putting in place a robust and sustainable water supply system through the Four National Taps. PUB’s good water management practice has made Singapore a role model for sustainable water management around the world and also landed it the prestigious Stockholm Industry Water Award 2007, one of the highest accolades in the water sector.

Mr Tan was also involved in the clean-up of Singapore River, a project that spanned ten years and involved many public sector agencies. The successful clean-up of the river made it possible for a dam to be built across the Marina channel, forming a new reservoir in the heart of the city while providing flood alleviation to low-lying areas in the city and offering recreational and lifestyle activities for all to enjoy.

Mr Tan was conferred the Clean Rivers Commemorative Gold Medal in 1987 for his efforts in the clean-up of the Singapore River and the Meritorious Service Medal in 2001 for his valuable contributions to water management in Singapore over the years.

With many years of expertise and experience in water management under his belt, Mr Tan is also concurrently the Chairman of Singapore Utilities International (SUI), PUB’s commercial arm. Formerly the Permanent Secretary of the then Ministry of the Environment, he also serves on several advisory panels, including the Environment & Water Technologies International Advisory Panel (EWT-IAP), the Centre for Water Research at National University of Singapore, the Clean Water Programme at Nayang Technological University as well as Keppel Technology Advisory Committee.

Mr Tan is also the chairman of the nominating committee for the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize, the key highlight of the Singapore International Water Week, a premier international water event.

Throughout his career, Mr Tan has played a significant role in growing and strengthening Singapore’s water supply system to what it is today. His invaluable contributions in the field of water make him a deserving winner of the President’s Award for the Environment 2007.
