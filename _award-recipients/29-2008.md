*Its commitment is best demonstrated by the management’s leadership and the enthusiasm of its employees in environmental management*

Alexandra Hospital is well-known for its energy and water conservation practices. Its commitment is best demonstrated by the management’s leadership and the enthusiasm of its employees in environmental management.

For a start, eco features such as energy-efficient appliances and solar panels are implemented throughout the premises, as a trial for the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH). Environmental messages are also displayed to constantly remind employees, patients and visitors to do their bit for the environment. As a result, the hospital consumes 50% less accumulative energy than typical hospitals. This is further enhanced by the hospital’s recycling scheme and water conservation measures.

Alexandra Hospital’s efforts in nature conservation have also been commended. Many areas have been set aside for nature appreciation such as the Butterfly Trail and Eco Pond, which not only accentuate the landscape of the hospital but also promote the well-being of employees and patients alike. These have since become an attraction for many locals and foreigners.

Extending efforts beyond its grounds, Alexandra Hospital has adopted the Yishun Pond under PUB’s Our Waters Programme. Through activities such as tree-planting and area clean-ups, Alexandra Hospital has been encouraging nearby residents to assume ownership of the pond. The hospital also organises activities at our reservoirs whenever possible, taking the chance to educate the populace on the importance of treasuring Singapore’s water resources.

For its significant contributions to the environment, Alexandra Hospital has been conferred both the EcoFriend and Watermark Awards. The hospital’s dedication to environmental protection is an excellent benchmark for both its stakeholders and peers.

#### South West CDC

*A leading community organisation that promotes community bonding through active participation in environmental programmes*

The South West Community Development Council (South West CDC) is a leading community organisation that promotes community bonding through active participation in environmental programmes.  Initiatives such as the Cool South West! Campaign engages the residents to combat climate change through actions as simple as using energy-efficient light bulbs and setting the air-conditioner to 25°C.

To help create a pleasant living environment for its residents, and build a greater sense of belonging, the South West CDC initiated the “My Environment Shines” programme in 2005 to raise the alert on public health issues.  This was expanded to “My Mall Shines” in 2006, “My Dormitory Shines” in 2007, and “My Hostel Shines” in 2008.  The 100,000 Native Plants @ South West programme was launched in 2007 to reinstate the natural heritage, as well as fight climate change, with 33 gardens with close to 100,000 trees, plants and shrubs grown to-date.

South West CDC actively engages community and corporate organisations to widen the spread of its environmental messages, such as the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Environmental Challenge Organisation (ECO) for the South West Junior Environment Ambassador Programme.

Paving the way towards social and environmental sustainability, the South West CDC’s draft ECo (Environment & Community) Plan South West brings the different environmental projects under a coherent master plan and deepens community involvement in environmental protection.

South West CDC’s dedication to ECo sustainability is most commendable, making it truly deserving of the President’s Award for the Environment 2008.
