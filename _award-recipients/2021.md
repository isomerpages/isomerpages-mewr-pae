Mr Joseph K H Koh is an influential and well-respected leader within local and regional environmental conservation circles.
 
Known as a spider expert, Mr Koh has authored four photographic guides on Singapore and Borneo spiders, and described 12 new species of spiders from Singapore and Brunei among the scores of scientific papers that he has published. Mr Koh was part of a core research working group which contributed to the Comprehensive Biodiversity Survey of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve from 2014-2018. Together with a team of budding arachnologists that he has nurtured, Mr Koh has recorded more than 800 species of spiders in Singapore. He has pledged his >12,000-specimen collection to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum of the National University of Singapore (NUS) and continues to devote time to pass on his skills and knowledge to young people with a passion for spiders.

Under his leadership, WWF-Singapore embarked on several collaboration projects with NParks to combat the illegal wildlife trade, and to garner public support of NParks’ species recovery programme and efforts to turn Singapore into a “City in Nature”. WWF-SG has also started to explore collaboration with other government agencies to help promote a “whole-of-society” approach to reduce waste and emission to further the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and beyond. As Chairman of the “Friends of Bukit Timah Forest” community group, Mr Koh has played a pivotal role in publicising the rich biodiversity in the forest ecosystem with Bukit Timah Nature Reserve as its core, and in developing a network of partnerships to involve more Singaporeans to protect, restore and enjoy the forest.  
 
Mr Koh has served as Chairman of NParks’ Nature Reserve Scientific Advisory Committee from 2012 - 2017 and was Chairman of the WWF-Singapore Board of Directors from 2018 to 2020 and is currently its Senior Advisor. Prior to that, he held key appointments in the Ministries of Finance, Home Affairs, Defence and Foreign Affairs. He was Singapore’s High Commissioner to Australia from 2002 to 2005, and High Commissioner to Negara Brunei Darussalam from 2006 to 2012. While pursuing a career in the public service, Mr Koh maintained close links with the NUS Department of Biological Sciences and was instrumental in encouraging and strengthening NUS’ biodiversity research ties with scientists from universities and research institutions of other countries. 
 
In the many roles he has held over the years, Mr Koh has helped to groom many passionate advocates for nature conservation, and deepened local and international understanding of Singapore’s environmental and biodiversity conservation efforts. He has also made significant contributions in the dialogue between the government and civil society  on issues related to environmental conservation, and continues to play an active leadership role in rallying community support to turn Singapore from a little red dot into a bright green spark.
