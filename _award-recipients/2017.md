An influential and well respected leader within the nature community, Dr Shawn Kaihekulani Yamauchi Lum’s leadership of the Nature Society (Singapore) since 2008 has been associated with many conservation and outreach initiatives that aim to make nature part of the Singaporean identity.

Acutely aware of the importance of engaging partners, Dr Lum worked with Sentosa Development Corporation and schools to protect endangered tree species under the Sentosa Green Wave Project. He advised landscape architect colleagues on the Jurong Eco-garden, a nature friendly project that won a President’s Design Award in 2014. Dr Lum’s invaluable contributions to Singapore’s biodiversity could also be seen in his caring for rare primary forest tree seedlings where he helped the Hopea Sangal trees escape extinction in 2002.

What sets Dr Lum apart is his ability to bring 3P partners together to seek consensus on conservation issues and his tactful mediation tactics between different agencies and citizens in pursuing solutions to balance development and conservation of green spaces. As a member of the Water Network Panel under PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, he also provides valuable advice on water conservation issues.
